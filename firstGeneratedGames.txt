Answer: First step, you can see the correct answers from the output of the following command:

\begin{code}
python -c "from sklearn import metrics; m = metrics.confusion_matrix(gold, predictions); print m"
\end{code}

where `predictions` is a numpy array containing all your predictions.

Then you can build your `question` prompts in a way that the predicted answer appears as a choice (as it is the case in your example), but the real answer must be the 1st one.

Finally, you could make your example more elegant by using a dictionary with category and explanation as keys, and list of predicted answers as values. Then you could use a `for` loop in order to read the prompts.

\begin{code}
gold_dict = {
    'Gilad Shalit': 'Gilad Shalit is the Israeli soldier who was released from captivity in exchange for many Palestinians',
    'North Korean leader': 'He married Kim Kardashian for 72 days',
    'Siri': 'the new intelligence software system for the iPhone that answers questions for you',
}

answer = [gold_dict['Gilad Shalit']]
